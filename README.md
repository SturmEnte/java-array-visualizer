# ArrayVisualizer Project

The ArrayVisualizer project offers an intuitive Java-based tool, primarily designed for educational purposes, to help students visualize array data in various contexts, such as demonstrating sorting algorithms. This tool is particularly useful in making abstract concepts more tangible and easier to understand.

## Key Features:
- **Visualize 1D Integer Arrays**: Transforms one-dimensional integer arrays into bar charts, enabling students to observe the behavior of elements in sorting algorithms dynamically.
- **Visualize 2D Boolean Arrays**: Represents two-dimensional boolean arrays as black and white grids, suitable for pattern recognition and algorithm demonstration.
- **Easy Integration**: Designed to be easily incorporated into other Java projects or educational materials to enhance learning experiences.

## Ideal for Education:
ArrayVisualizer is a perfect aid for teaching complex programming concepts in a visually engaging way. It brings arrays and algorithms to life, making it easier for students to grasp the mechanics of sorting, data structuring, and algorithm efficiency.
